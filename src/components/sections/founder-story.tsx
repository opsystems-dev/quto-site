                I've progressed from site engineer to project manager to operations manager.
                With each step up, I was determined to fix the problems and frustrations I'd faced before.
                Fifteen years of solving operational chaos from the inside, unlocking teams' potential only to watch it get stolen by the next administrative burden.

                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                Every construction company I've worked with struggles with the same operational chaos.
                Skilled tradies spending hours on paperwork they don't understand.
                Enthusiastic engineers turned into burnt-out administrators.
                Brilliant businesses drowning in admin overhead instead of focusing on what they do best.

                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                I've built solutions in Excel, Airtable, and nearly every platform imaginable - always hitting limitations, never fully satisfied. 
                AI finally makes it possible to build the tools we always needed. 
                These tools can transform businesses and improve people's work lives more than I ever could through consulting alone.

                        Realised delivering great work is only half the battle - admin overhead was growing out of control.
                        Making it better for one role often made it twice as hard for another.
                        Today's tools always falling short of what we really needed and often adding more work.
